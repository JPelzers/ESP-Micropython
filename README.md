# ESP32-Micropython_ChicagoCTA_NextStop

This is code to run a neat program on an ESP-32 microcontroller that displays the arrival times of the next tracked trains at any of the Chicago CTA Train stations.

Requirements:
- An ESP32 Chip
- An OLED Display, for this project I use one that is 128x64 monocolor but as long as it is supported by the Adafruit SSD1306 library you are fine with some minor code modifications (mentioned in the commments)
